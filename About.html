                            <h1>About Mardi Gras</h1>
                            <h2>Mardi Gras or Fat Tuesday, refers to events of the Carnival
                                celebration, beginning on or after the Christian feasts of the Epiphany (Three Kings
                                Day) and culminating on the day before Ash Wednesday, which is known as Shrove Tuesday.
                                Mardi Gras is French for "Fat Tuesday", reflecting the practice of the last night of
                                eating rich, fatty foods before the ritual Lenten sacrifices and fasting of the Lenten
                                season.

                                Related popular practices are associated with Shrovetide celebrations before the fasting
                                and religious obligations associated with the penitential season of Lent. In countries
                                such as the United Kingdom, Mardi Gras is also known as Shrove Tuesday, which is derived
                                from the word shrive, meaning "to administer the sacrament of confession to; to
                                absolve"</h2><br>

                            <h2>133–31 BC
                                Some think Mardi Gras may be linked with the ancient Roman pagan celebrations of
                                spring and fertility such as Saturnalia, which dates back to 133–31 BC. This celebration
                                honored the god of agriculture, Saturn. It was observed in mid-December, before the
                                sowing of winter crops. It was a week-long festival when work and business came to a
                                halt. Schools and courts of law closed, and the normal social patterns were suspended.

                                On the Julian calendar, which the Romans used at the time, the winter solstice fell on
                                December 25. Hence, the celebration gradually became associated with Christmas.</h2>
